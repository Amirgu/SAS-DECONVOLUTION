# SAS-DECONVOLUTION

Impementation of state-of-art Short and sparse blind deconvolution in Python following this paper:

'Short-and-Sparse Deconvolution â€” A Geometric Approach' by: Lau, Yenson and Qu, Qing and Kuo, Han-Wen and Zhou, Pengcheng and Zhang, Yuqian and Wright, John

### Algorithms Implemented : 

iADM and iADM with homotopy on 1D vectors on : iADM.py

iADM and iADM with homotopy and iADM with reweighting on 2D vectors or images on : iADM2D.py

### Notebooks :

Jupyter notebook of testing recovery of 1D vectors recovery  : test.ipynb

Jupyter notebook of recovering calcium image recovery : Deconvolve2D.ipynb
